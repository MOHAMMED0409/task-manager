# Pre-requirements and Running Commands

## Installation Steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

2. Create a new directory for the project:
   ```sh
   mkdir task-dashboard
   cd task-dashboard
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   npm install express
   npm install --save-dev nodemon
   ```

## Project Structure:

Create the following files in the project directory:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
- `server.js`

## File Content:

### index.html
Place the HTML content provided above here.

### style.css
Place the CSS content provided above here.

### script.js
Place the JavaScript content provided above here.

### server.js
Create a simple Express server to serve the static files:

```js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

Note: Make sure to move `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` into a `public` directory.

## Running the Project:

1. Start the server using `nodemon`:
   ```sh
   npx nodemon server.js
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the task management dashboard in action.
